# Virtual LIFO Device Driver - Linux Kernel Module

## Overview

This repository contains the design and implementation of a character device driver as a loadable kernel module (LKM) for a virtual Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) device. This project was part of an advanced Operating Systems course aimed at providing a practical understanding and application of OS concepts using the latest Linux Kernel.

## Project Highlights

- **Character Device Driver**:
  - Developed a virtual LIFO device driver implemented as an LKM.
  - Enables dynamic loading and unloading within the Linux kernel environment.

- **Kernel Code Analysis**:
  - Dedicated four months to an in-depth analysis of kernel code.
  - Enhanced understanding of operating system architecture and design principles through hands-on experience.
